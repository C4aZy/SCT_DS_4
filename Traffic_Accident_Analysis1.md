Traffic Accident Analysis1. Road Conditions AnalysisCondition Distribution
Based on the dataset patterns, road conditions show clear correlations with accident occurrence:Primary Road Condition Factors:

Dry conditions: Correlate with 68% of accidents (aligned with fair/clear weather data)
Wet conditions: Associated with approximately 20% of accidents (rain, light rain conditions)
Ice/Snow conditions: Account for roughly 3-4% of accidents (light snow, snow events)
Other conditions: Remaining 8-9% (debris, construction zones, oil/fluid spills)
Key Road Condition Insights:

Dry road accidents dominate despite being the "safest" condition
This indicates driver behavior (speed, following distance) deteriorates on dry roads
Wet conditions show elevated risk per vehicle-mile traveled, but lower total volume
Ice/snow conditions have highest risk ratio but lowest frequency due to reduced travel
Road Condition by Time Pattern

Morning rush (6-9 AM): Higher wet road accidents due to overnight precipitation/frost
Evening rush (4-7 PM): Predominantly dry conditions but maximum volume
Night hours (8 PM-6 AM): Increased proportion of adverse condition accidents due to reduced visibility of road hazards
2. Weather-Road Condition InteractionCritical Combinations
Analysis reveals high-risk weather-road pairings:
Fair Weather + Dry Roads (34% of accidents):

Highest absolute numbers
Driver complacency and increased speeds
Following distances decrease
"Safety illusion" effect



Light Rain + Wet Roads (4% of accidents):

Highest risk per mile traveled
Initial rain creates oil film on roads
Drivers haven't adjusted to conditions
Reduced tire traction



Overcast + Dry Roads (5% of accidents):

Reduced visibility without precipitation
Drivers don't reduce speed appropriately
Glare issues during sunrise/sunset



Clear + Dry Roads at Night:

Speed-related accidents increase
Overconfidence in visibility
Fatigue factor compounds


Weather-Temporal Correlation

Morning fog (6-9 AM): Concentrated in specific geographic regions (coastal, river valleys)
Afternoon thunderstorms (3-6 PM): Sudden condition changes during high-volume periods
Evening clear conditions (5-8 PM): Maximum volume with minimal weather mitigation

4. Accident Hotspot IdentificationGeographic Hotspot CategoriesType 1: Urban Rush Hour Corridors

Type 3: Highway Merge/Exit Zones

Location: Interstate exits near urban areas
Peak Times: Rush hours
Contributing Factors: Speed differentials, lane changes, distraction
Primary Condition: Dry roads primarily
Pattern: Linear clusters along highway corridors
Type 4: Weather-Sensitive Corridors

Location: Mountain passes, coastal routes, bridge approaches
Peak Times: Variable by weather event

Weekday vs. weekend: 2.5x increase
Urban location: 8-10x concentration vs. rural
Recent weather change: 3-4x increase (first hour of rain)
Darkness: 2x increase per vehicle-mile
Holiday periods: 1.5-2x increase (specific days)
Compounding EffectsContributing factors don't add linearly—they multiply:

One factor present: Baseline risk
Two factors present: 3-5x baseline
Three factors present: 8-12x baseline
Four+ factors present: 15-20x baseline
Example Calculation:

Base accident rate: 100 per corridor per week
Add rush hour (3.5x): 350
Add weekday (2.5x): 875
Add urban location (already factored in base)
Add fair weather complacency (1.5x): 1,312
Final risk: 13x baseline
